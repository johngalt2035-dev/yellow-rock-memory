## What Is This and Why Do I Need It?

`grey-rock-memory` gives Claude Code persistent memory across sessions. Without it, every conversation starts from zero. With it, Claude can:

- Remember your project architecture, preferences, and past decisions
- Recall debugging context from yesterday
- Build up institutional knowledge over time
- Never repeat the same mistakes twice

Think of it as a brain for your AI assistant -- short-term for what you're doing right now, mid-term for this week's work, and long-term for things that should never be forgotten.

## MCP Integration (Recommended)

The easiest way to use grey-rock-memory is as an **MCP tool server**. Once configured, Claude Code can store and recall memories natively without any manual CLI usage.

### Setup

Add to `~/.claude/.mcp.json` (global -- applies to all projects) or `.mcp.json` in your project root (project-level):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "grey-rock-memory",
      "args": ["--db", "/path/to/grey-rock-memory.db", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

> MCP server configuration does **not** go in `settings.json` or `settings.local.json` -- those files do not support `mcpServers`.

### How It Works

With MCP configured, Claude Code gains 8 memory tools:

- **memory_store** -- Store new knowledge (auto-deduplicates by title+namespace)
- **memory_recall** -- Recall relevant memories for the current context
- **memory_search** -- Search for specific memories by keyword
- **memory_list** -- Browse memories with filters
- **memory_delete** -- Remove a specific memory
- **memory_promote** -- Make a memory permanent (long-term)
- **memory_forget** -- Bulk delete memories by pattern
- **memory_stats** -- View memory statistics

Claude uses these tools automatically during conversations. You can also ask Claude directly: "Remember that we use PostgreSQL 15" or "What do you remember about our auth system?"

## Getting Started (CLI)

### Store Your First Memory

```bash
grey-rock-memory store \
  -T "Project uses PostgreSQL 15" \
  -c "The main database is PostgreSQL 15 with pgvector for embeddings." \
  --tier long \
  --priority 7
```

That's it. The memory is now stored permanently (long tier) with priority 7/10.

### Recall Memories

```bash
grey-rock-memory recall "database setup"
```

This performs a fuzzy OR search across all your memories and returns the most relevant ones, ranked by a 6-factor composite score:

1. **FTS relevance** -- how well the text matches (via SQLite FTS5)
2. **Priority** -- higher priority memories rank higher (weight: 0.5)
3. **Access frequency** -- frequently recalled memories rank higher (weight: 0.1)
4. **Confidence** -- higher certainty memories rank higher (weight: 2.0)
5. **Tier boost** -- long-term gets +3.0, mid gets +1.0, short gets +0.0
6. **Recency decay** -- `1/(1 + days_old * 0.1)` so recent memories rank higher

Recall also automatically:
- Bumps the access count
- Extends the TTL (1 hour for short, 1 day for mid)
- Auto-promotes mid-tier memories to long-term after 5 accesses

### Search for Exact Matches

```bash
grey-rock-memory search "PostgreSQL"
```

Search uses AND semantics -- all terms must match. Use this when you know exactly what you're looking for. Search uses the same 6-factor ranking but without the tier boost.

## Memory Tiers Explained

| Tier | TTL | Use Case | Example |
|------|-----|----------|---------|
| **short** | 6 hours | What you're doing right now | "Currently debugging auth flow in login.rs" |
| **mid** | 7 days | This week's working knowledge | "Sprint goal: migrate to new API v2" |
| **long** | Forever | Permanent knowledge | "User prefers tabs over spaces" |

### Automatic Behaviors

- **TTL extension**: Every time a memory is recalled, its expiry extends (1 hour for short, 1 day for mid)
- **Auto-promotion**: A mid-tier memory recalled 5+ times automatically becomes long-term (expiry cleared)
- **Priority reinforcement**: Every 10 accesses, a memory's priority increases by 1 (max 10)
- **Garbage collection**: Expired memories are cleaned up every 30 minutes
- **Deduplication**: Storing a memory with the same title+namespace updates the existing one (tier never downgrades, priority takes the higher value)

## Namespaces

Namespaces isolate memories per project. If you omit `--namespace`, it auto-detects from the git remote URL or the current directory name.

```bash
# These are equivalent when run inside a git repo named "my-app":
grey-rock-memory store -T "API uses REST" -c "..." --namespace my-app
grey-rock-memory store -T "API uses REST" -c "..."  # auto-detects "my-app"
```

List all namespaces:

```bash
grey-rock-memory namespaces
```

Filter recall or search to a specific namespace:

```bash
grey-rock-memory recall "auth flow" --namespace my-app
```

## Memory Linking

Connect related memories with typed relations:

```bash
grey-rock-memory link <source-id> <target-id> --relation supersedes
```

Relation types:
- `related_to` (default) -- general association
- `supersedes` -- this memory replaces the other
- `contradicts` -- these memories conflict
- `derived_from` -- this memory was created from the other

When you `get` a memory, its links are shown alongside it:

```bash
grey-rock-memory get <id>
# Shows the memory plus all its links
```

## Contradiction Detection

When you store a memory, grey-rock-memory automatically checks for existing memories in the same namespace with similar titles. If potential contradictions are found, you get a warning:

```
stored: abc123 [long] (ns=my-app)
warning: 2 similar memories found in same namespace (potential contradictions)
```

In JSON mode (`--json`), the response includes `potential_contradictions` with the IDs of conflicting memories, so you can review and resolve them.

## Consolidation

After accumulating scattered memories about a topic, merge them into a single long-term summary:

```bash
grey-rock-memory consolidate "id1,id2,id3" \
  -T "Auth system architecture" \
  -s "JWT tokens with refresh rotation, RBAC via middleware, sessions in Redis."
```

Consolidation:
- Creates a new long-term memory with the combined tags and highest priority
- Deletes the source memories
- Requires at least 2 IDs (max 100)

## Common Workflows

### Start of Session

Recall context relevant to what you're about to work on:

```bash
grey-rock-memory recall "auth module refactor" --namespace my-app --limit 5
```

### Learning Something New

When you discover something important during a session:

```bash
grey-rock-memory store \
  -T "Rate limiter uses token bucket" \
  -c "The rate limiter in middleware.rs uses a token bucket algorithm with 100 req/min default." \
  --tier mid --priority 6
```

### User Correction

When the user corrects you, store it as high-priority long-term:

```bash
grey-rock-memory store \
  -T "User correction: always use snake_case for API fields" \
  -c "The user prefers snake_case for all JSON API response fields, not camelCase." \
  --tier long --priority 9 --source user
```

### Promoting a Memory

If a mid-tier memory turns out to be permanently valuable:

```bash
grey-rock-memory promote <memory-id>
```

### Bulk Cleanup

Delete all short-term memories in a namespace:

```bash
grey-rock-memory forget --namespace my-app --tier short
```

Delete memories matching a pattern:

```bash
grey-rock-memory forget --pattern "deprecated API"
```

### Time-Filtered Queries

List memories created in the last week:

```bash
grey-rock-memory list --since 2026-03-23T00:00:00Z
```

Search within a date range:

```bash
grey-rock-memory search "migration" --since 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z --until 2026-03-01T00:00:00Z
```

### Export and Backup

```bash
grey-rock-memory export > memories-backup.json
```

Restore (preserves links):

```bash
grey-rock-memory import < memories-backup.json
```

## Priority Guide

| Priority | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| 1-3 | Low-value context, temporary notes |
| 4-6 | Standard working knowledge (default is 5) |
| 7-8 | Important architecture decisions, user preferences |
| 9-10 | Critical corrections, hard-won lessons, "never forget this" |

## Confidence

Confidence (0.0 to 1.0) indicates how certain a memory is. Default is 1.0. Lower confidence for things that might change:

```bash
grey-rock-memory store \
  -T "API might switch to GraphQL" \
  -c "Team is evaluating GraphQL migration." \
  --confidence 0.5
```

Confidence is factored into recall scoring (weight: 2.0) -- higher confidence memories rank higher.

## Source Tracking

Every memory tracks its source. Valid sources:

| Source | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `user` | Created by the user directly |
| `claude` | Created by Claude during a session |
| `hook` | Created by an automated hook |
| `api` | Created via the HTTP API (default for API) |
| `cli` | Created via the CLI (default for CLI) |
| `import` | Imported from a backup |
| `consolidation` | Created by consolidating other memories |
| `system` | System-generated |

## Tags

Tag memories for filtered retrieval:

```bash
grey-rock-memory store -T "Deploy process" -c "..." --tags "devops,ci,deploy"
grey-rock-memory recall "deployment" --tags "devops"
```

## Interactive Shell

The `shell` command opens a REPL (read-eval-print loop) for browsing and managing memories interactively. Output uses color-coded tier labels and priority bars.

```bash
grey-rock-memory shell
```

Available REPL commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `recall <context>` (or `r`) | Fuzzy recall with colored output |
| `search <query>` (or `s`) | Keyword search |
| `list [namespace]` (or `ls`) | List memories, optionally filtered by namespace |
| `get <id>` | Show full memory details as JSON |
| `stats` | Show memory statistics with tier breakdown |
| `namespaces` (or `ns`) | List all namespaces with counts |
| `delete <id>` (or `del`, `rm`) | Delete a memory |
| `help` (or `h`) | Show command help |
| `quit` (or `exit`, `q`) | Exit the shell |

In the shell, tier labels are color-coded: red for short, yellow for mid, green for long. Priority is shown as a visual bar (`████░░░░░░`).

## Color Output

CLI output uses ANSI colors when connected to a terminal (auto-detected). Colors are suppressed when piping to a file or another command. Use `--json` for machine-parseable output.

Color scheme:
- **Tier labels**: red = short, yellow = mid, green = long
- **Priority bars**: `█████░░░░░` (green for 8+, yellow for 5-7, red for 1-4)
- **Titles**: bold
- **Content previews**: dim
- **Namespaces**: cyan
- **Memory IDs**: colored by tier

## Multi-Node Sync

Sync memories between two SQLite database files. Useful for keeping laptop and server in sync, or merging memories from different machines.

```bash
# Pull all memories from remote database into local
grey-rock-memory sync /path/to/remote.db --direction pull

# Push local memories to remote database
grey-rock-memory sync /path/to/remote.db --direction push

# Bidirectional merge -- both databases end up with all memories
grey-rock-memory sync /path/to/remote.db --direction merge
```

Sync uses the same dedup-safe upsert as regular stores:
- Title+namespace conflicts are resolved by keeping the higher priority
- Tier never downgrades (a long memory stays long)
- Links are synced alongside memories

**Typical workflow** (laptop and server):

```bash
# On laptop, mount remote DB (e.g., via sshfs or rsync'd copy)
scp server:/var/lib/grey-rock-memory/grey-rock-memory.db /tmp/remote-memory.db

# Merge both ways
grey-rock-memory sync /tmp/remote-memory.db --direction merge

# Copy merged remote back
scp /tmp/remote-memory.db server:/var/lib/grey-rock-memory/grey-rock-memory.db
```

## Auto-Consolidation

Automatically group memories by namespace and primary tag, then consolidate groups with enough members into a single long-term summary:

```bash
# Dry run -- see what would be consolidated
grey-rock-memory auto-consolidate --dry-run

# Consolidate all namespaces (groups of 3+ memories)
grey-rock-memory auto-consolidate

# Only short-term memories, minimum 5 per group
grey-rock-memory auto-consolidate --short-only --min-count 5

# Only a specific namespace
grey-rock-memory auto-consolidate --namespace my-project
```

How it works:
1. Lists all namespaces (or the specified one)
2. For each namespace, groups memories by their primary tag (first tag)
3. Groups with >= `min_count` members are consolidated into one long-term memory
4. The consolidated memory gets the title "Consolidated: tag (N memories)" and combines the content from all source memories
5. Source memories are deleted; the new memory inherits the highest priority and all tags

Use `--dry-run` first to preview what would be consolidated.

## Contradiction Resolution

When two memories conflict, resolve the contradiction by declaring a winner:

```bash
grey-rock-memory resolve <winner_id> <loser_id>
```

This command:
1. Creates a "supersedes" link from the winner to the loser
2. Demotes the loser (priority set to 1, confidence set to 0.1)
3. Touches the winner (bumps access count, extends TTL)

The loser memory is not deleted -- it remains searchable but ranks much lower due to its reduced priority and confidence.

## FAQ

**Q: Where is the database stored?**
A: By default, `grey-rock-memory.db` in the current directory. Override with `--db /path/to/db` or the `GREY_ROCK_MEMORY_DB` environment variable.

**Q: Do I need to run the HTTP daemon?**
A: No. The MCP server and CLI commands work directly against the SQLite database. The HTTP daemon is an alternative interface that adds automatic background garbage collection.

**Q: What happens if I store a memory with a title that already exists in the same namespace?**
A: It upserts -- the content is updated, the priority takes the higher value, and the tier never downgrades (a long memory stays long).

**Q: How big can a memory be?**
A: Content is limited to 65,536 bytes (64 KB).

**Q: What is recency decay?**
A: A factor of `1/(1 + days_old * 0.1)` applied during recall ranking. A memory updated today gets a boost of 1.0, a memory from 10 days ago gets 0.5, and a memory from 100 days ago gets 0.09. This ensures recent memories are preferred when relevance is similar.

**Q: Can I use this with tools other than Claude Code?**
A: Yes. The MCP server speaks standard JSON-RPC over stdio. The HTTP API at `http://127.0.0.1:9077/api/v1/` is language-agnostic. Any tool that can make HTTP requests or speak JSON-RPC can store and recall memories.
